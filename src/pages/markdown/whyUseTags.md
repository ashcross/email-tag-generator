# Why Use Email Tags?

**Email tags let you use one email address as many unique addresses.** When you add a `+tag` to your email (like `yourname+shopping@gmail.com`), most email providers treat it as a unique address while still delivering everything to your main inbox.

## Common Use Cases

**Testing & Development**  
If you're testing a system that won't accept duplicate email addresses, you can use tags to create unique entries without managing multiple inboxes. Instead of creating `test1@domain.com`, `test2@domain.com`, etc., just use `yourname+test1@domain.com`, `yourname+test2@domain.com`.

**Service Tracking**  
Sign up for different services with tagged emails to see who's selling your data. Use `yourname+netflix@domain.com` for Netflix, `yourname+amazon@domain.com` for Amazon. If you get spam sent to the Netflix-tagged address, you know where it came from.

**Organization**  
Create automatic sorting rules in your email client. All emails to `yourname+shopping@domain.com` can go to a Shopping folder, `yourname+work@domain.com` to a Work folder.

**Multiple Accounts**  
Some platforms let you create multiple accounts with the same base email if you use different tags. Useful for managing separate profiles or testing different user types.

## Why Random Tags Are Better

**Unpredictable & Secure**  
Random tags like `yourname+x9K2mP@domain.com` can't be guessed or systematically generated by others. If you're testing user registration systems, random tags prevent conflicts with predictable patterns that others might use.

**Development Testing**  
When testing applications that need unique emails, random tags eliminate the mental overhead of thinking up new identifiers. You can rapidly generate `name+abc123@test.com`, `name+x7Y9nQ@test.com`, `name+p2R8kL@test.com` without worrying about duplicates.

**Load Testing**  
For automated testing scripts that create hundreds of user accounts, random tags ensure each test run uses completely unique email addresses without manual intervention.

**Multiple Identifier Layers**  
You can combine descriptive and random elements: `yourname+staging+x9K2mP@domain.com` or `yourname+client+abc123@domain.com`. This gives you both human-readable context and guaranteed uniqueness.

## How It Works

Most major email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) ignore everything after the `+` symbol when delivering mail, but keep the full address intact for the recipient. The receiving system sees unique addresses, but you get all emails in one inbox.

**Note:** Not all systems support email tags - some strip the `+` portion or reject tagged emails entirely. Always test with your target system first.
